            "faq": "Which AP courses should I consider taking?",
            "answer": "Our schools offer AP classes to most students starting sophomore year. These classes are more advanced and allow you to earn college credit in the form of AP testing. Inquire about these classes as a high school freshman. Learning about AP classes early on, you’ll know what to do when the time comes to register for them. Consider taking AP classes only in the subjects you are interested in to avoid burning out or taking too many classes."

Though you are only a high school freshman, it's good to make a plan and know where you're headed. In your MVLA planner, there is a list of requirements for high school graduation, and CSU entrance."
